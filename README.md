# You've Been Trolled Virus
This is a homemade virus me and my friend made at school.<br />
My friend was the idea man while I was the programmer.<br />
<br />
YBT (You've been trolled) can only be opened on windows.<br />
We included a batch file, `antidote.bat`, found in the resources folder, `/res`, to close it just incase it gets out of hand.<br />
You can access the program in the `ybt` folder.<br />
⚠️ The `trolled.js` file must stay with the `res` folder
<br />
<sub>Note: We are aware this isn't really a virus and it cannot spread.</sub><br />
